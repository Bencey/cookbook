# About me.

Hello Everyone, My name is Benjamin. I am currently a self taught IT Developer from New Zealand. I maintain a blog over at [bencey.co.nz](https://bencey.co.nz). 



### My Cookbook.
I decided that creating a dedicated website for documentation was much easier then the previous method (Just blogging about it), so I decided to create a documentation website which you are viewing now. I am planning on publishing guides on various things such as installing docker services, Installing certain programs, and much more.
